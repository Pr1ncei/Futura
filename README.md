Greetings, this is an initial README file about the project, will revise this in the future.
For now, this is my current tech stack that I plan for this project:

Tech Stack:
-----------
1. **GLFW** - For creating windows and handling keyboard/mouse input.
2. **GLAD** - OpenGL function loader to access modern OpenGL features.
3. **GLM** - Mathematics library for vectors, matrices, and transformations.
4. **SDL2 (Audio subsystem)** - For handling audio playback (sound effects and music).
5. **stb_image** - Simple image loader for textures (PNG, JPG, etc.).
6. **Dear ImGui** - For debugging UI and development tools.
7. **Assimp / tinyobjloader** - For importing 3D models (OBJ/FBX support planned).
8. **Bullet Physics (optional)** - For collision detection and physics simulation.
9. **CMake** - Cross-platform build system.
