# Futura
Futura is a work-in-progress multiplayer FPS written in C++ using OpenGL.
The goal of this project is to build a classic-style FPS engine inspired by games like Quake, Half-Life, and CS 1.6, while keeping the codebase clean, understandable, and fun to work on.

This is very much an active development project. Things will break, change, and get refactored as the engine evolves.

## Project Status
- Core rendering and FPS controls are already working
- Engine architecture and managers are currently being built
- BSP-based world rendering and collision are planned next

If you’re browsing the repo, expect unfinished systems, dirty code, and poorly-made decisions of a game since I do not know what am I doing.

## Roadmap: (6-12 Months Development Time)
Phase 1: Rendering Pipiline + FPS Controls **(DONE)**

Phase 2: Managers & Renderer Abstraction **(ONGOING)**

Phase 3: BSP World System (Rendering + Collision + PVS)

Phase 4: Entity System (GoldSrc-style)

Phase 5: FPS Gameplay (Weapons, Health, Rules)

Phase 6: Multiplayer Architecture (Client/Server)

Phase 7: Multiplayer Gameplay

Phase 8: Optimization & Polish

The roadmap is flexible and may change as development continues.

### Notes
This project is mainly for learning, experimentation, and long-term development.
If you’re interested in classic FPS engine design, BSP worlds, or low-level C++ game architecture, feel free to explore the code or follow along.

Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome once the foundation is more stable.
